## AlpacaTradingAPI
This class is for those who want to use Alpaca's API Trading platform but would rather not peruse the API documentation and create the code themselves.
The methods in this class are very user-friendly and crafted for ease-of-use in AlgoTrading strategy-building
### Important Notes
You will need to create an account with Alpaca Markets prior to using this and will need to generate you API and secret keys for the portfolio you want to use it with.
For the sake of your privacy, the API key and secret key should be stored in a different file such as `secret_tokens` and imported from there when running the class.
you will need to run `pip3 install requests`, `pip3 install json` and `pip3 install pandas` if you do not yet have these libraries.
Read and execute main file to understand usage of class
